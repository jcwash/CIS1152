##Prerequisite
CIS 1151 prerequisite for this class. If you have not taken that class or have a good understanding of the topics it covers, you should consider dropping this class and talking this class first. However, I understand that it may have been a while since you have taken that class. Because of that, below are some reference links to help get you back up to speed. It should be noted that these are outside links. I have looked at them enough to know that they are decent tutorials. Like anything on the internet, the content may change at any time. If you notice that they have become irrelevant or have a better suggestion please notify me so that I may change them.

##Grading
| Element | Grade Percentage |
|---------|----------------|
| Quizzes | 25% |
| Homework |40% |
| Final Project | 25% |
| Class Participation | 10% |

Letter grades will be determined using a standard percentage point evaluation. Grades may be curved after the total semester points have been tabulated. However, do not count on a curve to obtain your desired grade. Grades are determined as follows:

| Grade | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| A+ | 97-100 |
| A | 94-96 |
| A- | 90-93 |
| B+ | 86-89 |
| B | 83-85 |
| B- | 80-82 |
| C+ | 76-79 |
| C | 73-75 |
| C- | 70-72 |
| D+ | 67-69 |
| D | 64-66 |
| D- | 61-63 |
| F | Below 60 |

All assignments are due at the beginning of class on the date due. Exceptions are only made with a verifiable excuse (e.g. doctor or funeral directors note) or prior (i.e. before class) arrangement.

## Attendance
Lab attendance is mandatory.  If you arrive after I have taken attendance it will count as an absence.  If you miss more than 3 classes without legitimate and acceptable excuses then you will be administratively withdrawn from the class.

## Dishonesty Policy
Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may be punished by failure on exam, paper or project; failure in course; and or expulsion from the University. For more information refer to the "Academic Dishonesty" policy in the University Undergraduate Catalog.

Please be aware that plagiarism will not be tolerated. Nor will handing in someone else's work as your own. Such actions, if caught, will automatically get you a zero for the assignment with no option to make it up. Plagiarism of published material is grounds for automatic failure in this class as well as potential dismissal from the school. Who would want to hire a web designer that would open them up to expensive copyright infringement lawsuits?

## ADA Compliance
Students with disabilities, whether physical, psychological, or learning, who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Learning Specialist as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please meet with Robin Goodall to verify your eligibility for accommodation and/or academic assistance related to your disability. She can be reached at the Student Support Center (Conant 224), extension 1278, or by email (rgoodall@vtc.edu).

Students with disabilities may request accommodation as provided within federal law. All such requests should be made by first contacting Robin Goodall, Learning Specialist, in the Student Support Center (Conant 224). She can be reached by phone at 728-1278 or by email at rgoodall@vtc.edu. Information regarding services and supports, as well as documentation requirements, is available at the Student Support Center.

Anyone who feels they may be eligible for an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me to arrange an appointment to discuss the course format and the sorts of supports that may be needed. I rely on the Learning Specialist Office for assistance in verifying the need for accommodations and developing accommodation strategies. If you have not contacted the Learning Specialist, Robin Goodall, I encourage you to do so. She is available at the Student Support Center (Conant 224), ext. 1278, or by email at rgoodall@vtc.edu.

In compliance with college policy and equal access laws, I am available to discuss appropriate accommodations that you may require as a student with a disability. Request for accommodations should be made at the beginning of the semester, except for unusual circumstances, so arrangements can be made. Students are encouraged to contact Robin Goodall at the Student Support Center (Conant 224) (1278, or rgoodall@vtc.edu) for information regarding disability verification and for the determination of reasonable accommodations.

## Teaching Methods
###Hybrid Learning
This class is a hybrid learning class. You are expected to keep up with the reading and assignments. As two-third of this class is online, organization on your part will be key to getting a good grade in this class. The lecture and quizzes take place online; the amount of self study time required is as follows:

| Element | Time |
|---------|------|
| Lecture Time | 1 - 3 hours |
| Assignment Time | 2 - 3 hours |
| Textbook Reading Time | 3 - 4 hours |
| Question and Answer Period/In-Class Lab time | 2 hours |

Therefore, the class should take you between 8 and 12 hours a week. If the class is taking you more than 12 hours a week, please email me so we can discuss what may be causing the time issue. Remember, the onus is on you to stay involved in the class and on top of the assignments and your own learning!

## Assignments
Assignments will be given weekly. There is a pattern to the assignments that will be laid out in the course assignment sheet. Students will be expected to turn in the required assignments in a timely fashion each week. Additional assignments and bonus problems will be given, as the Instructor deems necessary and prudent.

Assignments will count for 40% of your grade. Most assignments will be coding exercises designed to give you practice in coding for the web and the basic principles of web page and web site design.

If there are problems, you have an opportunity to fix them and resubmit the assignment for a better grade the next week.

Assignments scores are based on 100 points. If assignment involves a program or script, and the program or script does not work, then the maximum possible score is 40 points out of 100, regardless of how small the error. To hand in something that doesn't work with no statement to this effect when handing it in is usually a sign that you didn't test it. Given that, a maximum of 40 points out of one hundred is pretty generous.

If an assignment is not turned in on time it is not eligible for regrading.

## Quizzes
Quizzes will be given to help ensure students stay up with assigned material. There will be a quiz in the online learning management system ever other week. Quizzes count for 25% of your grade. There will be no make-up quizzes.

## Final Project
The final project is the culmination of all that you have learned in this class. We will work on the idea behind the project starting in week 2. The code produced for the final project should be of such a quality that it could be used in your portfolio or as a code sample for a future employer.

## Software for this Class
This class requires some software.  However, it all can be found for free!

### Browser
A webpage looks different in different browsers and errors will appear differently in different browsers.  Because of this fact, it is best if we synchronize on the same browser. I will grade your projects using the latest release of Firefox. Please check to make sure that you code works in that version of the browser.

### Text Editor
You will need a plain text editor.  You cannot use Word, Wordpad, or Dreamweaver to create webpages.  You have to use a plain text editor.  If you don’t, I will know.  If you do use something other than a plain text editor you will receive no credit for the project.  This is a class that is about learning how to read and write code.  It is not about how to use a software product to fake it until you make it.

Also, I do not recommend you use a full fledged integrated development environment. It adds a lot of overhead and complexity that is not necessary for this course.

For reference I use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com). I find it to be a very capable editor. There is a free trial, but it does cost money. You can use whatever text editor suites your purposes. Some free options I have had good luck with with are [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) for Windows and for Mac [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/).

If you cannot install software on your machine (or you don't want to) there is a solution. Lucky for you then that all operating systems come with a built in text editor.

- Microsoft Window -> Notepad
- Apple Mac OSX -> TextEdit
- Linux -> Joe, Kate, Gedit, Pico, Nano, vi, Emacs, etc…

### Git and Github
In this class I will use Git and Github to disseminate the assignments. I expect that you will also keep your assignments in GitHub. You will create a repository for this class and I will pull your assignments by pulling from the repository. If this sounds scary don't panic[^1]. There is a git tutorial document (that also has quite a few things to say on the subject of towels[^1]) and Assignment 1 will help you set up the repository.
