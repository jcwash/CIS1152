# Lab 2 - Working with Logic and Algebra

## Lab notes
The lab this week with be our first real excursion into PHP. For the following problem sets, I have given you the formula to calculate a problem. Using only mathematical operators and datatype manipulation solve the following problems. See the project `lab_2.php` for more information.


## Problem 1 - Convert Fahrenheit into Kelvin
\\[ T째k=(T째f-32) * \frac{5}{9} + 273.15\\]
> T째k = Temperature in degrees Kelvin
> T째f = Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit


## Problem 2 - Volume of a Dodecahedron
\\[ V=\frac{15+7\sqrt{5}}{4}a^3\\]
> V = Volume of the Dodecahedron
> a = length of one edge


## Problem 3 - Truncate a floating point value at 2 point of precision
\\[t = (f * 100) \backslash 100\\]
> t = truncated floating point value
> f = un-truncated floating point value


## Problem 4 - Impact velocity of a falling object
\\[v=\sqrt{(2gh)}\\]
> v = velocity
> g = gravity (9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>)
> h = height
